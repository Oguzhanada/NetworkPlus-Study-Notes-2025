# 📡 Network+ Study Notes (N10-009)

Welcome to my personal Network+ study repository.  
This repo contains the notes I created while preparing for the **CompTIA Network+ (N10-009)** exam.  


My goal with this project was simple:
- Break down every exam topic into small, digestible files  
- Explain each concept in my own words  
- Include real examples, troubleshooting notes, and exam tips  
- Organise everything in a clean structure that makes studying easy and enjoyable  

If someone else reads this repo, I want it to feel like they’re reading the notes of a real student, not a textbook.

## 🧠 How I Use This Repository

### **1. Daily Revision**
I choose 2–3 files per day and review them slowly.  
Since each file is short and focused, revision is easy and doesn't feel overwhelming.

### **2. Practice Questions**
Many files include small questions I wrote myself to reinforce key ideas based on common exam patterns.

### **3. Troubleshooting Practice**
Whenever I forget something (e.g., “How does STP work again?”),  
I open that specific file instead of digging through a long textbook.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo is not a textbook.  
It’s a clean, simple, and practical set of notes I built for myself.  
If future me opens this repo months later, I want everything to be instantly useful.

## ✔ Status
**Actively expanding with new notes and improvements.**
